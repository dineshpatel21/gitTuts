/* 
Wildcards let you match many files or folders at once:

* matches any number of characters ( *.tmp      # all .tmp files )
? matches a single character ( my?ile.txt # matches my1ile.txt, myAile.txt, etc. )
[abc] matches any character in the set ( log[0-9].txt # log1.txt, log2.txt, ... log9.txt )
[!abc] matches any character not in the set 

Negation (!) ( *.log !important.log )

Comments and Blank Lines
# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore temp folders
temp/ 


Local & Personal Ignore Rules
If you want to ignore files only for yourself (not for everyone who uses the repository), add them to .git/info/exclude. This works just like .gitignore but is not shared.
